Carbon Emission Project SQL and PowerBI

In this project, I have analyzed and visualized my dataset using SQL and PowerBi.
I will use this dataset to discover some aspects: India's highest and lowest amount of carbon emission by Year,
the country with the most significant and most downward emissions per capita in 2017 compared to the changes of emissions per capita
in 1975, top 5 carbon dioxide emitting countries, India' ranking among the top 5, etc.

1. About the project:
a. Some highlighted features that I will use when I work with SQL: 
- SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- AGGREGATION FUNCTION: MIN(), MAX(), SUM(), ROUND()
- CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, INNER JOIN, CREATE VIEW

b. Some highlighted features that I will use when I work with PowerBI: 
- column chart, Pie chart, Slicers, Clustered column chart, Maps, Heat Maps, Buttons,Donut Chart
 

2. About the dataset: 
- There is one database in my project: 

a. Carbon Emission Database: 
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vineethakkinapalli/united-nations-environment-data?select=Water+and+Sanitation+Services.csv)
- Overall: The database contains the amount of carbon emissions per capita in a country as well as total carbon emission in countries over the world. 
- Tool: SQL to clean and analyze, PowerBI to visualize
